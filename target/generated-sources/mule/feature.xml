                       Version 3, 29 June 2007&#xD;
&#xD;
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;&#xD;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xD;
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                            Preamble&#xD;
&#xD;
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for&#xD;
software and other kinds of works.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed&#xD;
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,&#xD;
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xD;
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xD;
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xD;
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xD;
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xD;
your programs, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xD;
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xD;
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xD;
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xD;
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xD;
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xD;
&#xD;
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xD;
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xD;
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xD;
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xD;
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xD;
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xD;
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xD;
know their rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xD;
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xD;
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xD;
&#xD;
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xD;
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and&#xD;
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xD;
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xD;
authors of previous versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xD;
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xD;
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xD;
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xD;
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xD;
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xD;
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xD;
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xD;
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xD;
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xD;
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xD;
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xD;
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xD;
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xD;
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xD;
modification follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
  0. Definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xD;
&#xD;
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xD;
works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xD;
&#xD;
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xD;
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and&#xD;
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xD;
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xD;
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the&#xD;
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xD;
on the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xD;
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xD;
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xD;
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xD;
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xD;
public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xD;
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xD;
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xD;
&#xD;
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"&#xD;
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xD;
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xD;
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xD;
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xD;
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xD;
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xD;
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
  1. Source Code.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xD;
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source&#xD;
form of a work.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official&#xD;
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xD;
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xD;
is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other&#xD;
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xD;
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xD;
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xD;
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xD;
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xD;
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component&#xD;
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xD;
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xD;
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all&#xD;
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xD;
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xD;
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's&#xD;
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xD;
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xD;
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xD;
includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xD;
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xD;
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xD;
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xD;
subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xD;
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xD;
Source.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xD;
same work.&#xD;
&#xD;
  2. Basic Permissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xD;
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xD;
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xD;
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xD;
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xD;
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xD;
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xD;
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xD;
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xD;
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xD;
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xD;
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xD;
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xD;
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xD;
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xD;
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xD;
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xD;
makes it unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xD;
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xD;
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xD;
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xD;
measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xD;
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xD;
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xD;
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xD;
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's&#xD;
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xD;
technological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you&#xD;
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xD;
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xD;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xD;
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xD;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xD;
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xD;
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xD;
&#xD;
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xD;
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xD;
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xD;
    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xD;
&#xD;
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xD;
    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xD;
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xD;
    "keep intact all notices".&#xD;
&#xD;
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xD;
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xD;
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xD;
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xD;
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xD;
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xD;
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xD;
&#xD;
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xD;
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xD;
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xD;
    work need not make them do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xD;
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xD;
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xD;
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xD;
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xD;
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users&#xD;
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xD;
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xD;
parts of the aggregate.&#xD;
&#xD;
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xD;
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xD;
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xD;
in one of these ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xD;
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xD;
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xD;
    customarily used for software interchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xD;
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xD;
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xD;
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xD;
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xD;
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xD;
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xD;
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xD;
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xD;
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xD;
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xD;
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xD;
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xD;
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xD;
    with subsection 6b.&#xD;
&#xD;
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xD;
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xD;
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xD;
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xD;
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xD;
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xD;
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xD;
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xD;
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xD;
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xD;
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xD;
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xD;
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xD;
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xD;
    charge under subsection 6d.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xD;
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xD;
included in conveying the object code work.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any&#xD;
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xD;
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xD;
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xD;
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xD;
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a&#xD;
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xD;
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xD;
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xD;
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xD;
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xD;
the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,&#xD;
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xD;
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xD;
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xD;
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xD;
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xD;
modification has been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xD;
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xD;
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xD;
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xD;
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xD;
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xD;
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xD;
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xD;
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xD;
been installed in ROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xD;
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xD;
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xD;
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xD;
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xD;
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xD;
protocols for communication across the network.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xD;
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xD;
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xD;
source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xD;
unpacking, reading or copying.&#xD;
&#xD;
  7. Additional Terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xD;
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xD;
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xD;
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xD;
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xD;
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xD;
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xD;
this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xD;
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xD;
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xD;
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xD;
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xD;
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xD;
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xD;
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xD;
&#xD;
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xD;
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xD;
&#xD;
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xD;
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xD;
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xD;
&#xD;
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xD;
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xD;
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xD;
&#xD;
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xD;
    authors of the material; or&#xD;
&#xD;
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xD;
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xD;
&#xD;
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xD;
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xD;
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xD;
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xD;
    those licensors and authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further&#xD;
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xD;
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xD;
governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xD;
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xD;
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xD;
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xD;
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xD;
not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xD;
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xD;
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xD;
where to find the applicable terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xD;
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xD;
the above requirements apply either way.&#xD;
&#xD;
  8. Termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xD;
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xD;
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xD;
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xD;
paragraph of section 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xD;
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xD;
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xD;
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xD;
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xD;
prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xD;
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xD;
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xD;
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xD;
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xD;
your receipt of the notice.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xD;
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xD;
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xD;
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xD;
material under section 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xD;
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xD;
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xD;
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xD;
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xD;
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xD;
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xD;
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xD;
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xD;
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xD;
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xD;
&#xD;
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an&#xD;
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xD;
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xD;
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xD;
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xD;
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could&#xD;
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xD;
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xD;
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xD;
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xD;
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xD;
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xD;
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xD;
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xD;
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
  11. Patents.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xD;
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xD;
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".&#xD;
&#xD;
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims&#xD;
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xD;
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xD;
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xD;
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xD;
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xD;
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant&#xD;
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xD;
this License.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xD;
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to&#xD;
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xD;
propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xD;
&#xD;
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express&#xD;
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xD;
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xD;
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a&#xD;
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xD;
patent against the party.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xD;
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xD;
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xD;
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xD;
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xD;
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xD;
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xD;
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xD;
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have&#xD;
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xD;
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work&#xD;
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xD;
country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xD;
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xD;
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xD;
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xD;
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xD;
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xD;
work and works based on it.&#xD;
&#xD;
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within&#xD;
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xD;
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xD;
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xD;
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xD;
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xD;
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xD;
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xD;
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xD;
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xD;
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xD;
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xD;
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xD;
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xD;
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xD;
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xD;
&#xD;
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xD;
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xD;
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xD;
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xD;
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xD;
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xD;
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xD;
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xD;
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xD;
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xD;
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xD;
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xD;
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xD;
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xD;
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xD;
combination as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xD;
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xD;
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xD;
address new problems or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xD;
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xD;
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the&#xD;
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xD;
version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xD;
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xD;
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xD;
by the Free Software Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xD;
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's&#xD;
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xD;
to choose that version for the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xD;
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xD;
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xD;
later version.&#xD;
&#xD;
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xD;
&#xD;
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xD;
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xD;
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xD;
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xD;
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xD;
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xD;
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xD;
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xD;
&#xD;
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xD;
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xD;
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xD;
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xD;
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xD;
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xD;
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xD;
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xD;
SUCH DAMAGES.&#xD;
&#xD;
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xD;
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xD;
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xD;
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xD;
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xD;
copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xD;
&#xD;
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xD;
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#xD;
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#xD;
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xD;
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#xD;
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}&#xD;
    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}&#xD;
&#xD;
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&#xD;
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#xD;
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&#xD;
    (at your option) any later version.&#xD;
&#xD;
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xD;
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xD;
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xD;
    GNU General Public License for more details.&#xD;
&#xD;
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xD;
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.&#xD;
&#xD;
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short&#xD;
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xD;
&#xD;
    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}&#xD;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.&#xD;
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xD;
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.&#xD;
&#xD;
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate&#xD;
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands&#xD;
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".&#xD;
&#xD;
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,&#xD;
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.&#xD;
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see&#xD;
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.&#xD;
&#xD;
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program&#xD;
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you&#xD;
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with&#xD;
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General&#xD;
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read&#xD;
